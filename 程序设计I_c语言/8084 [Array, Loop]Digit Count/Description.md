# [Array, Loop]Digit Count

# Description

For an integer N, you can write 1 to N in one line. For example, when N=12, the number from 1 to N written in a line, we can get a new string: 123456789101112

There are one '0', five '1', two '2', ..., one '9' in the new string. Your task is very easy, for a given N, tell me how many '0','1','2',...,'8','9' in the new string which write down from 1 to N?

 


## Input

The first line contains an integer T (1<=T<=10), indicating the number of test cases.

Then, for each case, there is only a number N (1<=N<=1000).


## Output

One line for each case, print the number of '0','1','2',...,'8','9', separated by a space.
